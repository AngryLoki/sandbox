# As stated in sandbox.conf, any value in here do not get used if the variable
# is already present in the environment.  All rules of the ACCESS Section
# applies here.

# Also note that SANDBOX_WORKDIR is a special variable that is just set if
# sandbox is run interactive (ie, no commandline options), and points to the
# current directory.

# Normally the whole filesystem should be readable
SANDBOX_READ="/"

# Finally add current directory if interactive
