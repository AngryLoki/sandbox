implement limited support for static ELFs with ptrace ?

cache results of filesystem checks

add tests to make sure errno is saved/restored properly

wrappers for execl{,l,p} ... unfortunately, we'll probably have to basically
reimplement the functions (building up argv[] and then call the execv* ver)

erealpath() might deref symlinks when working with unreadable paths as non-root
even when working on funcs that do not deref funcs themselves ... this isnt a
real big issue though

add a whitelist system for static binaries rather than hardcoding into source
